# Default Prediction Research Project

**Project Description**

Employ and design an **explainable** model to estimate the **term structure of cumulative default probabilities** — a structured estimation that contains default probabilities from short-term to long-term periods (E.g., 1, 3, 6, 12, ..., 60 months)

# Environment

Neural network models have been implemented by two different ML frameworks: PyTorch & TensorFlow 

**PyTorch Version**
* Python 3.8
* PyTorch 1.11.0

Other Packages: Check the **requirements.txt** file in the corresponding folder

# How to Run the Program

First, go to the data directory and execute the get_data.sh script to download complete data (Refer to Dataset Description for more information)
(warning : the full dataset cannot be loaded in the model due to the limit of CUDA memory)
```
$ cd codes/data
# Make sure you are on server cfda4
$ bash get_data.sh
```
or create the sample data from following steps
```
$ cd codes/build_sampling/preprocess
$ bash sampling.sh
```

Second, choose which dataset you want to use: cross-section or cross-time

And then go to the corresponding **run_models_scripts** directory

Finally, execute the corresponding bash script of the model you want to run

**Cross-section** : run on the cross-sction dataset
```
$ cd codes/run_models_scripts
$ bash ./run_gru_index.sh
```
**Cross-time** : run on the cross-time dataset
```
$ cd codes/run_models_scripts
$ bash ./run_gru_time.sh
```
Note: Just ignore the tf warnings shown on the terminal

# Expected Results
Reproduce the results of Tables 1 & 2 of the paper: Multiperiod Corporate Default Prediction Through Neural Parametric Family Learning

**Results generated by the code in the repo (Pending update...)**: Collect results.csv **average** column: cap -> AR & recall -> RMSNE


# Data Description
**Dataset Used**

A real-world default and bankruptcy dataset provided by **CRI**, which is publicly available and contains 1.5 million monthly samples of US public companies over the period from **January 1990 to December 2017**

* CRI Official Website: https://nuscri.org/en/home/
* NUS Credit Research Initiative Technical Report: https://d.nuscri.org/static/pdf/Technical%20report_2020.pdf
* Initially preprocessed data: merged.csv

**Data Overview**
* Check file **Check_Data.ipynb**'s contents (Notice that the read file path will be different if you want to execute the code on the server)

**Data Path on Lab Server**
* CRI raw data: **cfdaAlpha**:/tmp2/cywu/default_cumulative/data
  * Unzip nus_raw.tar -> Get raw_data folder
    * Files: Company_Mapping.csv, File_Location_by_Firms.csv, US_Firms_Specific
  * Initially preprocessed data (Refer to code files in Default_Prediction_Models/TensorFlow_Ver/preprocess/)
    * Files in folder interim 
* Complete processed data for above mentioned implemented models: **cfda4**:/tmp2/cywu/default_cumulative/data/processed
