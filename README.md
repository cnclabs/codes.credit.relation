# Default Prediction Research Project

**Project Description**

Employ and design an **explainable** model to estimate the **term structure of cumulative default probabilities** — a structured estimation that contains default probabilities from short-term to long-term periods (E.g., 1, 3, 6, 12, ..., 60 months)

**Revised Part**
  * To enhance the accuracy of the predicted results with relational information, we will incorporate the ADGAT model.
  * To meet the model's requirements, the dataset loader output will be adapted to accommodate multiple companies.
  * To reduce GPU memory usage, we have implemented a data sampling function.
  * Import the early stop function and set the patience parameter.
  * To align with our proposed approach, we will modify the Graph_GRUCell model in Layer.py to enable weight value sharing.

# Environment

Neural network models have been implemented by two different ML frameworks: PyTorch & TensorFlow 

**PyTorch Version**
* Python 3.8
* PyTorch 1.11.0

Other Packages: Check the **requirements.txt** file in the corresponding folder

# How to Run the Program

First, go to the data directory and execute the get_data.sh script to download complete data (Refer to Dataset Description for more information)
(warning : the full dataset cannot be loaded in the model due to the limit of CUDA memory)
```
$ cd codes/data
# Make sure you are on server cfda4
$ bash get_data.sh
```
or create the sample data from following steps
```
# The build_sampling folder is not attached in github, get it from cfda4:/tmp2/yhchen/Default_Prediction_Research_Project/explainable_credit/codes/build_sampling
$ cd codes/build_sampling/preprocess
$ bash sampling.sh
```

Second, choose which dataset you want to use: cross-section or cross-time

And then go to the corresponding **run_models_scripts** directory

Finally, execute the corresponding bash script of the model you want to run

**Cross-section** : run on the cross-sction dataset
```
$ cd codes/run_models_scripts
$ bash ./run_gru_index.sh
```
**Cross-time** : run on the cross-time dataset
```
$ cd codes/run_models_scripts
$ bash ./run_gru_time.sh
```
Note: Just ignore the tf warnings shown on the terminal

# Expected Results
Reproduce the results of Tables 1 & 2 of the paper: Multiperiod Corporate Default Prediction Through Neural Parametric Family Learning

**Results generated by the code in the repo (Pending update...)**: Collect results.csv **average** column: cap -> AR & recall -> RMSNE

# Current Results
We anticipate that the inclusion of the ADGAT relation model will enhance the results with an explanation that can be understood. After fine-tuning the parameters, we achieved the following optimal outcomes

## The SDM model without relation vs SDM model with relation

* We sample 500 companies with cross-section dataset
* adgat=incorporate agdat relation model
* hidden size = {32, 64, 128}
* learning rate = {1e-03, 1e-04, 1e-05}
* weight decay = {1e-04, 1e-05, 1e-06}
* Number of Layer = 1
* batch size = {1, 5, 10, 15}
* patience = {20, 50, 75, 100}
* max epoch = 300
